== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does the free account work? =

After you create a free account, you will get immediate access to all free features for up to 100 submissions per month. Paid features are availble to be tested on draft/unpublished projects. You will get automatic notifications when you reach certain thresholds for the submission count and when you reach the monthly submission limit, you can choose between our paid plans and pay by credit card inside the dashboard. If you reached your limit and decide not to upgrade to a paid account, your projects will get locked until the next calendar month starts.

= What is the difference between a trial and the free account? =

You created an account, tested the platform with the free plan and you are still not sure if a paid plan is right for you? In this case you have the option to trial a paid plan for 14 days for free. To start a trial you have to provide your billing details beforehand and choose a plan. Please be aware that if the trial is not canceled within the 14 day trial period, the selected plan will start automatically. You can change or cancel your plan anytime. The difference to the free plan is that you can use absolutely all paid features and even publish the projects that are using paid features. The limitation of 100 submissions per month is also valid for any trial plan, but you are able to skip the trial period at any time.

= Do I have to pay for new features? =

No, we roll out updates to our software constantly, add new templates and you get it all for FREE! As involve.me is on the cloud, when we make an update or add new features, they automatically show up in your account.

= Do I have to install anything? =

Not a thing, as we've developed involve.me so you wouldn't have to have a whole IT department to run your interactive landing pages. Just login, start clicking, and you can build all of the interactive standalone pages and widgets for your website right inside our tool.

= Who owns the feedback data, the content and the personal info? =

You do! Any content (including your users) is 100% owned by you (specifically the owner of the organization account). involve.me doesn't have permission to use that content or contact your users for any reason. involve.me is just a tool for YOU to deliver YOUR content!

= If I cancel my involve.me account, will I lose my data? =

In contrast to most "software-as-a-service" platforms, when you cancel your involve.me account, your data will not become inaccessible, however paid features will not work anymore after you switched to the free plan. Before canceling you have the opportunity to download CSV and XLS files of your collected data. Projects using paid features will stay available in the account and can be reused if you decide to subscribe a paid plan anytime again.

= Can I cancel my account at any time? =

Sure, the owner of the organization account can change the billing plan at any time if they decide involve.me is no longer for them. Cancelations can be made anytime and will be effective at the end of your current billing period.

= How much coding know-how is required to use involve.me? =

Creating involve.me content is as easy as dragging and dropping content elements on a canvas and designing them with our pre-made themes or by choosing fonts, colors, transparency, highlights & much more yourself. When you publish a project we provide the code and link you’ll need to embed or share your content. You don’t need to write a single line of code for anything.

= How safe is my data? =

involve.me is being run on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and our servers are located in Frankfurt, Germany. The AWS cloud infrastructure has been architected to be one of the most secure cloud computing environments available on the planet. According to the security features built into the AWS service, we employ 128-bit SSL encryption for all data transfer on the involve.me platform, periodical backups of all your data, as well as various security protocols in all our work premises.

= What if I reach my monthly quota of submissions? =

We will notify you via email when you reach 50%, 80% or 100% and lock your projects when the limit is reached, so they won't accept anymore visits or submissions. If you prefer, you can upgrade to a higher plan, or wait until the next month when we reset your submission quota.

= What can I do with the data I've collected? =

You can download your data as an XLS & CSV files, or use our native integrations and Zapier to automate data transfer as it’s being collected. You can also save time and automate tasks by forwarding submissions to any URL you choose through our webhooks feature.

= I have additional questions. Where can I find more answers? =

If you still have questions, check out our payment terms page, our help center or start a chat with our support.
